Data Analysis to find a good place to live


## Big idea

When trying to identify a place to live, and in the absence of a specific job or other relationship pulling you to a specific area, often I'm left looking at entire cities. Individual neighborhoods would be better.

## Project Plan

1. Start with all cities in the US with more that 50k people
2. Score all states with societal livability factors (e.g., guns, lgbtq+ inclusiveness)
3. Get individual neighborhood walk scores from walkscore.com
4. TBD
  4.1 Get School information
  4.2 Get Housing price information
